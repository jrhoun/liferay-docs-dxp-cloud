# Real-Time Alerts

Alerts inform you of any unexpected behavior in your project. You can therefore 
respond to problems quickly. You can choose which alerts to receive and how you 
receive them. 

## Alert Preferences

You can configure your alerts by clicking your profile photo at the top-right 
corner of the console page and selecting *Alerts Preferences*. This takes you to 
the Alerts Preferences page, where you can configure which alerts you receive 
and how you receive them. For each alert, select the checkbox for how you wish 
to receive it. To disable an alert, unselect all its checkboxes. Click 
*Save Alerts Preferences* when you're finished.

## Alerts Page

Alerts delivered to your console are accessible from the bell icon on the top 
bar. There, you can filter alerts by environment and mark them as read. Each 
alert is triggered by a specific event. If the event is still happening, its 
alert status is *Ongoing*. If the event is finished, its alert status is 
*Resolved*. The table also contains *Started at* and *Duration* columns that 
tell you when the event started and how long it lasted, respectively.
