# Support Access

When customers open tickets via Help Center, the Liferay support team typically 
resolves the issues by asking questions and interacting with customers. Some 
cases, however, require Liferay support members to access the customer's 
environment to analyze and diagnose issues in more detail. Customers can enable 
or disable this access on an environment-by-environment basis. 

| **Note:** Support access is enabled by default in each environment. 

## Changing the Support Access Setting

You can enable or disable support access on an environment-by-environment basis. 
Support access is enabled by default in each environment, but you can disable it 
at any time. For example, you can choose to enable support access on the 
development environment but have this option disabled on the production 
environment. 

| **Note:** Only administrators can change the support access setting. 

Follow these steps to change the support access setting: 

1.  Navigate to *Settings* &rarr; *Support access*. 

2.  Set the toggle switch to your desired setting (*Enabled* or *Disabled*).

## Monitoring Changes to Support Access

Any change to support access registers a new activity that lists who made that 
change and when. These activities appear in *Activities* &rarr; *General*. DXP 
Cloud also sends an email to all team members when the support access setting 
changes.
