# Networking

Your DXP Cloud services can communicate securely with external services and 
other services in the same environment. Here, you'll learn how to use and 
configure these features: 

**Load Balancer:** Handle all public connections with DXP Cloud's advanced load 
balancer. 

**Private Networks:** Communicate between services in an environment via that 
environment's private network. 

**Custom Domains:** Configure your custom domains with DXP Cloud's intuitive 
domain router. 

**VPN Connection:** Connect your DXP Cloud services to external services that 
have their own private network.
