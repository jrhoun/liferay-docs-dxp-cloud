# Development Lifecycle

DXP Cloud helps you manage your applications throughout their development 
lifecycle. You can use DXP Cloud to build your application and mange the builds 
in your environment. Once a build succeeds, you can deploy it to any 
environment. DXP Cloud also contains 
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) 
continuous integration by default, and persistent storage volumes for your 
services.
