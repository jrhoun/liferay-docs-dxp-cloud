# Builds and Deployments

DXP Cloud helps you manage your applications throughout their development 
lifecycle. You can use DXP Cloud to build your application and mange the builds 
in your environment. Once a build succeeds, you can deploy it to any 
environment. DXP Cloud also contains 
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) 
continuous integration by default, and persistent storage volumes for your 
services.
