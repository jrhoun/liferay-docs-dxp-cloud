# Builds and Deployments

DXP Cloud helps administrators manage applications throughout their development 
life cycle. Administrators and developers can use DXP Cloud to build an 
application and manage the builds in their environment. Once a build succeeds, 
administrators can deploy it to any environment. DXP Cloud also uses 
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) 
continuous integration by default and persistent storage volumes for their 
services.
